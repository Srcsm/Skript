This repository is made exclusively for the Qrid Minecraft server. 
I will do my best to keep this repo up-to-date, though the files located in the server may be more recent. If you wish to make any changes, make sure that the file is current with the server by asking me directly if possible. Otherwise, I will have to attempt to patch your code into the current files.
